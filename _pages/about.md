I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. My research interests lie in systems and networking. I have worked at technology companies such as Airbnb and Google, focusing on cutting-edge technologies in data center network infrastructure and cloud infrastructure.
