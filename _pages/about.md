Welcome! I am an engineer and researcher at Google, working in the Network Infrastructure team where I help build Google's data center networks (including topology, routing, traffic engineering, software-defined networking, control plane performance and scalability). I received a Ph.D degree in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

My research areas are computer networks and networked systems.
