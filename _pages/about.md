Welcome! I recently joined Aribnb's network infrastructure team, working on cutting edge technologies of cloud native network stack from Layer3 - Layer7 and contributing to the key infrastructure components that connect all Airbnb users and services across the globe. 

Before that, I was a senior engineer and researcher at Google, worked in the network infrastructure team where I helped build Google's data center networks (including topology, routing, traffic engineering, software-defined networking, control plane performance and scalability). 

I received my Ph.D degree in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research interests are computer networks, networked systems, data center networking, software-defined networking, congestion control, network measurement and security.
