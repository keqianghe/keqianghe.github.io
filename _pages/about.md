I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, with research interests in systems and networking. After spending several years in academia—including roles at UW–Madison and IBM Research—I have most recently worked at technology companies such as Airbnb and Google, focusing on cutting-edge technologies in data center networking and cloud infrastructure.
