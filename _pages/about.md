Hi, I am a researcher in computer systems and networking, with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. My research focuses on data center networking, cloud infrastructure, and machine learning systems. I have also worked at Google and Airbnb, where I applied systems research to large-scale production environments.
